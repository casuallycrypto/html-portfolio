<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Shaun and little did I know going back to Hinthunt was the best thing that could happen to me in my life so far</p>

<p>The reason I say this is due to the one random connection I made.
  Granted there are a few I ended up getting along with, but one connection stood out the most
</p>

<p>That girl, my word, I never expected that one conversation we had to blossom into what we have now</p>

<p>I mean... uhh.. she's dumb</p>
